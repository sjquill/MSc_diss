Title: Survival Analysis in Clinical Trials: a Comparison of Statistical and Machine Learning Approaches.

Project Description: A comparison of performance of a number of machine learning, deep leanring and statistical approaches to a the Cox proportional hazards model using data from the trial; "Four Versus Six Cycles of Cyclophosphamide/Doxorubicin or Paclitaxel in Adjuvant Breast Cancer", by Lawrence N. Shulman et al. (NCT00041119).

The code in this folder is the code for one of the three datasets analysed in this study. The other two datasets were from the VITAL trial (NCT01169259), and the PRIME trial (NCT00364013).

Below are come comparison plots between the Concordance Index and Integrated Brier Scores from the various models on the three datasets.
